"""Retry policy, defined once.

Every outbound call that can fail transiently uses this decorator rather than
its own loop, so the backoff curve, the jitter and the log line are identical
wherever they appear. The OpenAI-compatible audio clients are the deliberate
exception: the SDK already retries internally, and stacking two policies on one
call turns a 10-second timeout into a minute of silence on a live phone call.

    Jitter matters more than it looks: without it, every agent worker that lost
